- 👋 Hi, I’m @evadunn
- 👀 I’m interested in descriptive statistics, using exploratory data analysis techniques to explore distributions, outliers, and relationships.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis in Seattle, focused on using postgreSQL, mySQL, Python and Tableau in project development and assessments. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data preparation, data transformation and dashboards to visualise stories for presentations, particularly in global development.
